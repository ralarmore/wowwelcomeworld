<b>“Classic Italian Tiramisu Recipe”</b>
<br><br><i>This recipe comes from a package of Forno Bonomi Ladyfingers I once purchased at a bakery in Las Vegas. Tiramisu never disappoints, and it's so easy to make! <br>
<br>
*One mistake I make almost everytime with this recipe is contaminating the egg whites with the yolk. Clean the whisk! Any amount of fat in the egg whites will make the whipping process a whole lot more work than it needs to be.* </i></p>

<b>Ingredients (10 portions)</b>
<li>500 g Ladyfingers </li>
<li>630g Mascarpone Cheese</li>
<li>370ml Strong warm coffee </li>
<li>150g Sugar </li>
<li>5 Eggs </li>
<li>Bitter cocoa for dusting</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Beat egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl until it appears pale and thick. <br>Add the mascarpone and mix gently until very stiff. <br><br>
Beat egg whites and a pinch of salt in a separate bowl until soft peaks form, then gently fold them into the mascarpone mixture. <br><br>
Prepare the coffee, pour it into a shallow dish and let it cool down. <br><br>
Dip the Ladyfingers quickly into the coffee one at a time and arrange them side by side, in a serving dish. <br>Cover the biscuits with the mascarpone mixture. <br>Use all the Ladyfingers and the cream to form more layers. <br><br>
Top with a layer of cream mixture. <br>Dust the top with cocoa. <br>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. </p>

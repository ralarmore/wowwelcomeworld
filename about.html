        <p>I'm Ruth Larmore, a writer and visual artist living in the Northeastern US.
       I was born in Las Vegas and moved east to learn about organic regenerative farming. Working on farms has been an incredible experience, and now I am getting back into other creative work. Currently, I'm working on a series of vignettes about the confusions of intimacy.  <br>
       My poetry has been published in BAG Magazine and Storm of Blue Press. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I am currently working as a freelance writer, editor/proofreader, and graphic artist. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any inquiries!

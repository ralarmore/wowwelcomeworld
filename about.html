        <p> My name is Ruth Larmore. I'm a writer, visual artist, and carpenter's apprentice living in the Northeast.  
       I was born in Las Vegas where I received an MFA in Creative Writing. I moved eastward to learn about organic regenerative farming. A good friend of mine said that I would love it, and I did! Now I am getting into other creative work. It is my mission to always be learning and exploring.
